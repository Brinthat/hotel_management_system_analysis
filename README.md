This project, undertaken by a group of students, involves analyzing and proposing solutions for the modernization of XYZ Hotel, a Bed and Breakfast in Brighton, UK. The hotel, owned by an elderly couple, faces challenges in automating its operations, which currently rely on manual processes.


Objectives:
1. Identify Issues: Investigate the lack of automated booking processes and the reliance on physical documentation.
2. Propose Solutions: Recommend the implementation of a web-based Channel Manager for booking automation and a Database Management System (DBMS) for digital documentation.
3. System Analysis: Examine current tasks and processes, identify user roles, and create use case and ER diagrams.
4. Design Phase: Develop proposed solutions using use case and data flow diagrams, class diagrams for data storage, and a system construction plan.
5. Testing: Outline a test plan to ensure the system meets all requirements and functions correctly.
6. Conclusion: Summarize the project's findings and emphasize the importance of user engagement and comprehensive testing to achieve the hotel's strategic goals.

Key Components:
Company Background: Description of XYZ Hotel and its strategic plan.
System Analysis: Investigation of current processes, task analysis, and proposed solutions.
Design Phase: Detailed design of proposed solutions, including diagrams and system construction plans.
Testing and Implementation: Comprehensive test plans and prototype models to ensure successful implementation.

Outcome:
The project aims to streamline XYZ Hotel's operations by reducing manual tasks, improving data accuracy, and enhancing customer satisfaction through modernized IT systems. This comprehensive approach seeks to align the hotel's operations with its strategic goals, ultimately boosting efficiency and revenue.
